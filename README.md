# GifTastics

This project is where i learned to pull information from and API, and display is on the screen. It was a great learning experience for me and i enjoyed it alot. 

All you do is put your favorite sport in the input feild and click the add button, then a button with that sport name will appear on the screen. You can click the button, and it will display gifs that have to do with that sport. All the gifs load on the page as still images, for faster load time for the page. You just have to click on the gif to animate it, and click it to stop the animation.

Thanks for taking a look!!!
